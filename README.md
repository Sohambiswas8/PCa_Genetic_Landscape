# PCa_Genetic_Landscape

This repository contains the code, data, and supplementary files supporting the study, "*Toward the genetic landscape of prostate cancer in India: insights from whole-exome and low-pass whole-genome sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues*". The README provides an overview of the project, instructions to reproduce analyses and figures, and links to the raw and processed data.
For reproducibility, analyses are organized by folder (data, scripts, results, figures) and include environment/installation notes
